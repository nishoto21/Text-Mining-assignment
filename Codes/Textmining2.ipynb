Thanks to amazon Some amazing set of books. My 1.5yr old nephew loves them. He walks around asking us to read with him. Books are durable too and can take a beating, tantrums, fingering and even a bit of soaking and still last.The syllabus is interesting to. Its a bit Canadian I think, yet relevant for Indians. Would buy more from this publisher for sure. 100% recommended. Buy it for a kid in the family or for a friend\\'s kid as a gift. This is the second time I bought this.  I had bought for my daughter and now I got this to gift it to a toddler.  Very good product.  My neighbor kids also come to my hiymuse just to play with those books.  Really engaging for the kids.  My daughter loves those.  And I have these since my daughter was 10 months old  n she is 2 years old now still play with those books.  Has learned many things. Books are made of hard cardboard type paper. Good for small kids, as they have tendency to tear pages. It\\'s good If pages are made up of waterproof material. Books are small in size but good quality pictures.Due to it\\'s small size kids can handle them easily. Nice start to reduce screen time for kids. The concept is good.topics r covered in a nice way only problem is that the pages aren\\'t that thick,my 1 &half year old kid has easily folded it\\'s pages vertically on very first day,so slightly disappointed. It is really nice product to help kids learn faster.Can\\'t complain about quality for product as it is very good. Though I had to apply for exchange (Free) as first time the seller delivered used/old product with even teeth marks on few of the books.My daughter as soon as she wakes up she browse through all the book. She seems to enjoy a lot. Wow...when i saw ths its too pretty books for small infant child.. Definately its a first book of my child to learn abc nd all..clear pictures nd colours its too bright for creating a intrest on books, i easily carry all books in my purse. Thnx for giving a nice product Very good set of books. Gave it away as a gift but wish I had kept it for my kid.Books are small but perfect for toddlers to handle. Big and bright pictures. Perfect for new learners.Will definitely recommend it to friends. I not open the sealed of book packing. I noticed the book size is very small and think inner content/picture will be also small that will recognizable by my kids brain. she is suffering autism. Thus I return it. I\\'m not going to lie! They are small books but, board books usually comes in this size.For the price point, this purely is a gem in the category.Best to get started. This is super cool to initiate & nurture reading habits into our little ones. Don\\'t expect your tiny humans to show interest in reading at the very beginning. Allow them to explore the colour/images first. My 7 month old just loves to go through it for the vibrant colours. The size of the books was very small!!!!!!!!,so small that it doesn\\'t look like a book even!!!! It is the size of a floppy disk. The picture given in the site of Amazon is very misleading,shows that the book is very big.my 2 year old daughter plays with it as a toy as throws it away rather than reading it.moreover it doesn\\'t not have a return policy in it .I feel cheated.the books that we get in footpath for 30 rs are better than this.i really  doubt how it got so good reviews. Good quality, real pics of day to day things, good contrast usedEasy to hold for babiesReal images, only one image per page,Wwhich is a good thing, no distraction for babyMy kido loves to reaad yyhem , play with them carry them around the house..  a must buy... Actually product quality is good but problem is in every picture their is similarity or repetition of pictures for eg in fruits u normally get to see fruits thats right but in numerical again fruits are repeated so the basic concern is grasping gets confusing for child as vocal sounds are different for same picture ie- 1 numb you see one apple and so on so if that is being rectified the product can be eligible for 5 star. Minor things but it has a huge impact These books are really good with colourful pictures. These are board books means hard cardboard like books, cannot be torn easily by kids.Caution if the kids throw the book on us it will hurt us badly😄, books are really good, must buy for toddlers, kids gets attracted To it Glad to have picked a cloudtail product for my baby..Excellent as always..delivered with perfection...no complaints...saved me time and money 💰..I hope cloudtail and Amazon will be around when my baby grows up and begins to shop online...Thanks for everything.. These books are great. Kid loves them and asks parents to read the books to him everyday. It’s hard for kids to tear these books. And books are small making them easy to carry. You can just pop a book in your pocket while taking your kid out 😀 This product was a value for money , with good apt learing information for a baby. Good quality and each page has one figures which makes is easy for a baby to point out or remember. Love these books, they are so easy to carry few to keep a toddler engaged during travel, etc. They like to arrange and pull out the books from the box. It is toooooo small. Not as given above. The dimensions are not as mentioned in the product description. Have attached pictures of the same with dimensions. Giving 3 stars for the quality of the product. Please change the picture. It is misleading. Returns are also not allowed. I would have bought a bigger one. In this price you will get a set of 10 basic books which are super good for your kids who are growing up. I gave it to my nephew who is only  1.4 year old. He loves it. He keeps Playing with it for an hour and he started recognising animals and fruits. So worth buying it It is a perfect gift for my 1.8year old baby.Liked a lot and play with it and start finding the content in it .........I saw some users reviewing here about size of the book...for them i must say these library books are for 1-3year old kids not for the adults to use.... Go for this without any second thoughts. Book It\\'s on exact size it needs to be. Very easy to carry with infants around. Sturdy. Hard covers. Pictures are real and in white background without any deviation. My baby enjoys seeing it. Good though of having all the basic topics n a single nutshell.The only con I would say is we see few repetitive objects across all the books. I e Brocolli n vegetables and in Green colour as well. This might be corrected to include as many new words/ pictures as possible. Otherwise great buy. No regrets. Palm sized board books for babies .. easy to hold and no worry of torn pages. The categories and pictures will interest my kid to go through them. It’s bright and colourful. Bought this for my 1.5 year old boy. He loves these books! We read these everyday and he doesn\\'t get bored looking through the same books over and over again (especially the transport book!). He\\'s already learning and recognizing so many new things. This is such a healthy distraction from cartoons/mobile/TV.Pros:- board books, so will not tear bend easily- rounded edges, will not hurt the child- colourful clear images on every page- 10 topics, so lots to learn- pocket size, so easy to carry aroundLovely set of books to keep your child engaged. I\\'ve ordered the second set as well! 1. Nice Packaging & Timely delivery.2. The content & presentation is good, kids would love going through the books. It will surely aid in their learning process.3. The books are robust, it will withstand the rough handling by the l\\'il champs.4. Just the size of the books may disapppint you. But overall it is value for money. I bought this book a few days ago,when I received it I was amazed to see the quality,the round edges,glossy finish,naturalization,color,size,combination well though out book for children definitely a buy if you children at home,any children loving parents would love it,it is the best alternative of mobile phones,children love it,learn from reading books.Seller part.The image is a bit mis-leading it looks like A4,but actually it is smaller than post card size. I think seller should change the images shown on Amazon website.Amazon is always the best in delivering the item in well packed and on time.Thank you,For making your customers smiling like your company log. The book has very foolish content for small kids of 2, 3, 4 yrs young kids. They are showing blue color parrot, they show animals guiana pig which is rarely found, they show i for igloo, q for quilt , etc etc so many most difficult animals and birds names which are rarelynused in day to day life and very difficult to learn for 3 yrs old kids. They should have given some daily used content so that kids can easily remember and can use in their day to day life. A simple book series with a picture and word per page (except for the abc book\\'s last few crowded pages). A child can learn and improve his/her vocabulary with this series. The pages are completely worn out due to heavy usage almost everyday. A warning for the parents!!!. Be prepared to read this book again and agian with your baby since they may ask for you to read them every single day for more than five to six times!!! For a complete look of the set visit my YouTube channel - gforgratitude, i have fliped through the pages from the whole set.A small thing that i found is that, there are two styles of this book series, with same content but in a different font and picture layout style. So, you may get a random set. we bough first set of the same series & we figured that they released second set as well. So, we bought this one without any second thought!We bought it for 350 inr thanks to amazon. Books are just perfect for your small kid. They will play with them as small objects initially & then eventually they will start learning to turn on pages & see different images which are of good color quality. When they grow up, the same set of book will serve as good vocabulary source for learning. The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n            \\n                \\n            \\n        \\n    \\n    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    \\n  \\xa0I really like these board books. Firstly, my 20 months kid can\\'t tear these books. He can touch and feel in his own way.Secondly, these books are designed perfectly for the new learners. All pictures have white background which helps our kid to learn fast. This set of 10 books is what my three-year-old always asks for, everytime I open my cupboard. This package includes a set of 10 pocket sized cardboard books, one each for fruits, vegetables, modes of transport, wildlife, domestic animals,birds, shapes, colors, numbers, and A to Z. The pics are crystal clear, bright and attractive. Overall quality of the book is worth spending your bucks!The only two negative things I found is that the book consists of all things American. I doubt if parents in India will be able to relate to many fruits, veggies, animals shown in this book, which are not found in India. Can\\'t blame the publisher, as the book set is imported from US.Secondly, I thought the book is of full size, of around the size of an A4 page, but the package arrived too small. It is infact pocket sized books for kids. Otherwise, truly a delight for the little ones to learn while they play! Thumbs Up! These are RS. 40 each in loose and a pack of 100 would have costed me only RS. 400/- but still, as I had to gift it I thought of buying as this set comes with hard bound case for easy storage and display.To my disappointment the case is torn on sides and now I will have to repair it before gifting. BOOK ARE REALLY GOOD, BUT AGAIN U CAN EASILY FJND THEM IN ANY OF YOUR NEARBY TOY STORE. I have well researched many books & concluded to this one.  I got it for 399 from amazon. Colors are just perfect. You might get feeling that books are small in size. But if you carefully research , all board books are of this size.Books are very well designed. Corners are kept rounded to avoid accidental hurting to your baby. Content is well researched as well... What more! My Grandson very interested these books. In twenty months of age he reveals all the titles of the pictures. Paper quality and pictures quality are good. No question of torn the books anyway. Delivery was on time packaging was excellent the Board books are of superb quality came in a card bird box there are 10 books each of which is very nice in terms of quality and colour go for it your baby’s will love it It’s a cute collection, but I wasn’t expexting the size of the book to be this small . But still the books are awesome.  Have 12 leaflets in all the book Books are way to small for a child to learn. Because a 1 or 2 year old child needs to see bigger pictures in order to understand everything. One should buy individual books rather than this library. A big no this.Hope you all find this helpful! The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n            \\n                \\n            \\n        \\n    \\n    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    \\n  \\xa0an excellent set of initial basic things for a child to learn and it is got multiple pages also inside each book I am really impressed. However wait a little before you buy these books, my child is six months old and as with every other thing he was trying to eat this book as well. 🙆🏻\\u200d♀️🙆🏻\\u200d♀️🙆🏻\\u200d♀️ But I am keeping the box anyways. 🤷🏻\\u200d♀️🙋🏻\\u200d♀️💁🏻\\u200d♀️ I really liked the books. My 4 month old baby really likes to see the images. Also its travel friendly. I prefer to show him books rather than engaging him with mobile phone. I loved the product so much..maybe more than my 1.5 year old daughter😜😁Of course she loved it...The quality of the books are so much high on the mark... The content is so much appealing and informative for age till 3or4...so it can be used for long time.. Even though I was a bit apprehensive of the cost..I realize that The books are worth every penny... Amazing book for pre schoolers..a must buy... Writing this review after 3 months of usage. Very rugged, well build and strong board books. My 9 moth old son (back then) llhad literally abused them to greater lengths but they still are intact. Minor bends here and there which are not uncommon. My son has chewed, poured water, stood on them, Tried to press against the Binding and what not. They still are running strong. The books seem water resistant if not water proof. Coming to the content, they are clear and vibrant. My son has learnt a lot in the last six months. One tip is to read the books to your kids atleast 15 to 20 min every day. They will develop the back of glancing or reading these board books. Can\\'t be more happy. One of the best purchases If you are reading this space then I would highly recommend you to buy this set. It is so engaging for little babies. With its small size, babies can hold it perfectly and can flip through the pages and can be engrossed in so many varieties of topics. Best quality books with 10 sets of knowledge your infant/child can get from animals, vegetables, fruits, etc. Really nice book go for it! Pages won\\'t tear so easily so very durable. Definitely worth buying. My baby has learnt so many words from this book. Especially, ABC, farm animals and wild animals book.Few of the animals we can\\'t see in India so it\\'s difficult to explain it to them. Like ferret  and Ginnie 🐖. Really informative books. I bought them for my 15 months old toddler and he is just love with them. He keeps on browsing them and want to do more and more. They have also helped me in making him learn a lot of things. Great quality of books, it covers all topics - alphabets, numbers, shapes, animals etc. which we need a 2 year kid to see and know. My niece loves to play with it. Did I really expect her to read the books at this? naah :) ... Great educational product at a very affordable price. The book quality is just awesome. The design is made in such a way that it will seek your kids attention. Very compact and can be carried easily . Very good set of books for the initial learners with very good pictures n bold letters. My grand daughter of 2 Yrs of age liked all the books very much.. Highly recommended for kids who are started learning their first lessons.. Book size very small. But hard board quality, pictures printing and book finishing is really good. Slightly expensive, but serves the purpose. Collection is good. Good pictures, perfect size for the Little ones...it would be best if they have included all the BASIC animals, vegetables, n fruits...each book have 25pictures but some of content I found is unnecessary. Bought them for my 1 year old. Books are very good. Quality is also great and so is the content. Keeps him engaged. Worth buying for little ones. Go for it in case you are looking to buy some for your little one I highly recommend these boards books for children above 1 year. My kid is so happy flipping the pages and identifying animals, fruits etc. It is very convenient for my kid to hold it as it is of small size and he thoroughly enjoys it. I was so impressed by these books that I gifted these books to my nephew as well. I am glad that i bought this set. My baby have learned a lot from this. The size is perfect for babies though it may look small at first glance. Trust me i have tried a bigger book and it was too big so got torn within a week. My baby will read this book as soon as she got up and before going to bed everyday. Totally worth it. This is my 3rd purchase and slowly has been my default gift for kids. First birthday along with some toys. They love them and the colours are bright and the book is hard cardboard material so kids can’t tear it (for the little active kids too) Thats the picture of book colors. Now how do you expect me to teach color by this? It should have had only plain color blue. Butterfly sapphire was not required. Same goes with numbers Book is 10cm in length. It\\'s board book.. It\\'s not books. This are pocket books.Wrong way to sell item by naming BOOKS but actually item\\'s are SMALL POCKET BOOKS.Basically fraud selling of small pocket books on description of Colour printed learning books, actual prices are Rs.100-150. A great product to familiarise your toddler with some common names. He can see things and relate. My son enjoys it the most. Dont go by long names. Even if he learns one name from each book & identifies it, its enough. He carries atleast one book everywhere he goes. My son will turn 2 in may. Nice product for small babies. You should buy this when your baby is just 1 yr old and he will start liking it and can enjoy it upto 3 yrs or more also. It has animals, fruits, numbers, transportation etc books. Your kid will get familiar with all these things. And most important , develop a love of reading, touching and enjoying books. The product is small, curved corners so that your baby will play and don\\'t get harmed. A must buy😍😍 Awesome product. My daughter luved a lot but I feel size of the book is bit small and the thickness should be more coz our book\\'s easily got Torn. And im unhappy that one of my book condition was not good so bad but I didn\\'t return. Very tiny books.. Not satisfied with the size of the book. Given limite page. Easy to carry.. Less weight. My baby didt get attract much on this book while comparing to other picture books. Need better pictures.. Feels like repeated pictures Books are smaller in size than I thought. Buy my kid loves the transport and animal books. The alphabet book has some weird choices like B for Bear instead of Ball and a few others, so it doesn\\'t work well with most rhymes videos online Kids are visual learners and ever since I bough this for my 2.5 year old daughter, she always keeps bringing these books and eagerly enquires about the contents.She learned the names of animals and colours fast, thanks to this library. All you need to do is have patience as kids tend to repeatedly ask the same question multiple times about same item :D I bought this for my 13 month old son who has just recently shown tendencies to read his books and not chew on them or tear them apart.When I unwrapped the set of books, I felt disappointed as they were smaller in size than I had assumed. But within minutes, I realised that the size was perfect for my son. We spent 40 minutes right away browsing through all the books. Getting that kind of attention span from my son very active son isn\\'t easy usually.Quality and colours are really good. Easy to carry. This book set is a must buy. The book box is really good. Initially, my daughter kept playing with it to remove the book and put it back.The book\\'s classification is well thought to give a kid a flavor of different things to visualize. There are minor pictures which could have been done better - such as having pictures of things which we Indians can visualize, and for Nest word, the picture is of a nest with big eggs and everyone\\'s eyes will go on eggs rather than a nest. Anyway, this is quite a minor issue which we will observe in any best books. The book size is small which is just to know before buying but handly for a kid. Overall the quality of information, book, and book box quality make it work buying for a 2-3 years kid. 499 is far too much for 10 tiny books.  The books are not very strong also, a baby can easily tear them apart Bought this set of board books for my daughterVery handy for her learning basic stuffsEven though my area is lockdown & free neighbouring areas are sealed, Amazon delivered the product on time as promisedLooked the product very muchThough my daughter is yet to learn all the stuffs she seems too happy to get thisOne Star is reserved for a month long usage & durability test It\\'s very good as a first book for your baby. They are colourful, hard and durable. This is good choice for small babies, because they first chew , taste everything.  These books are sturdy, even if your baby chews, bites ,it is not affected. Remain in the original form My 2 yrs old son absolutely love these books. He started saying A, B, C faster than expected. We have now started Numbers and Colors.Quality of this book is good, not easy to tear off. That\\'s most important because children handle books roughly. Size wise book fits inside palm. So easy to carry in bag in case you want to keep children occupied Choose this one since this book has actual picturevrather than a cartoon/comic version or a hand drawn version of the same which kids might have difficulty to relate while looking at real life objects. Anither thing is, this set is prepared keeping in mind US audience. The picture for train isn\\'t relevant, avocado is not an Indian thing, many animals in the books are not found in India. It keeps tour baby engaged because of the vibrant content. Nice buy The quality of these board books is just great. The pictures are aptly represented and the content is great too. I bought it when she was 13 months old and she still loves opening the books every now and then and goes through them. She\\'s picked up quite a lot of stuff from these. Please add them to your collection! One of the best buy. It\\'s of great quality. Nicely designed. The corners are rounded wisely so not to hurt the little ones. Pages are thick enough so little ones can\\'t tear them off easily. Small in size(refer to the images posted by customers before buying) but does it purpose.My 3y old just loves it. It comes with a small box to store all the books after use. Thats also nicely designed. Usually I do not write reviews but just loved this one so thought of writing one. my baby (1.5 year old) loves it, material is very good as well.While buying I read in reviews that the outer cover is not good quality and tears apart easy but it seems they have improved on it. My baby takes out books from it 100 times a day but it\\'s still as is. (Using daily since 1 month) I bought it after seeing its good reviews but really disappointed after getting it. Size is too small to handle the thing even on a single page, some pages having two items to display to save pages Rightly called as the Library with so many books in it. The pages are hard enough to not be torn by your kid. Colours are bright and attractive. I only wish few examples related to Indian context and culture were a part of such books. Very good collection of book.  As it is made of thick material it will not get torn easily. It is colourful. The size of the books are small so it is easy for my 1.5 yrs old toddler to hold it and flip pages. Good quality board books. My 2 year old was really excited seeing it and she loves it. The packing and print quality is also very good. Only thing they could have included nursery rhymes as one book instead of farm animals or wild animals or transport. That is why it is rated 4 stars. Oh my baby loves his library. It’s perfect for my baby. He is just 9month old but still enjoy seeing colourful pictures and playing with these small books that is so handy for him. Good quality with  very clean and clear pictures . Books are very small in size......it will be better if the books were little bigger in size....by the way pages are of very good quality, pictures are very attractive and colourful.....overall i like it..but size matters alot..... It has real photos of things in various categories such as transport, fruits, and the like. This enhances the learning process as the child can see the real thing, not the animated version. THis is a nice set of 10 books, worth for it, in fact a nice gift also for first birthday I assume. Quality is good, we can wipe the pages if required, I wish the pages have bit more thickness. Images and their colors are very natural, paper quality is good and book are handy to be carried easily by kids. But a few vegetable varieties, and their names; some English words , are not common to India. For example, instead of aeroplanes, they have give airplane; and colors teaching book is not attracting my kid interest. My girl really loved these books. She started observing, speaking more difficult words, she loves farm animals more😄. Very good gift for a kid more than chocolate or biscuits 👍 Wonderful set. My toddler is 18 months and she loves learning from this. Extremely child friendly and durable. Only issue is the book discussing alphabets has the characters in small and unnecessary images. So my daughter ended up learning those images instead of alphabets This set of books is very cute. Handy and is of good quality. My son loved flipping through the pages and stopping at a certain page and I told the name of the fruit/object/animal on that page. It\\'s a fun way to teach our kids. They\\'ll be attracted to the colourful pictures. Awesome set of books - small size :Handy for kids,Clear pictures :avoids confusion ,No sharp corners : Great design ,Useful variety of books. Animals, wild, pet , fruits veggies, vehicles etc : Great source or knowledge. Nice product.Material is so nice also the cards are thick so that child can\\'t tear it also it is oil coated so it is safe for first learner\\'s.My  kid is enjoying with this pretty good set of books for early learning, would had preferred more of indian centric veg fruits as some listed are imports not originally avaliable in india...! The books comes in small size almost the size of an adults palm. But the images and letters are big enough for the little ones to learn it all. The material these books are made off is also pretty good. Overall a very good set of books for 2-4 years old ideally. Quality of the BOOKLET is fabulous.  Bought it after reviewing the uploaded images of the people, little disappointed with the size, but print and quality of the paper is top notch.  Keep up. Nice product with pictures that keep the little ones engrossed.! The pages are solid cardboard and the books could have some more pictures maybe.However no complaintsOnly that the cover was damaged when received. However the books were safe thankfully. Size is a bit small ( should be at least 1 inch more in length) The pictures are exactly the colours, that should be . Very nice ..  for my Grandson\\'s first library. Thanks Good quality books. Serves its purpose. I had assumed that the box may not be of any use but it is surprisingly good. It does give us the feel of a little library every time baby tries to pull out a book. Good quality. Clear pictures and captions. Very userful to start book habit for babies and start teaching them bacis of fruits vegetables pet and wild animals vehicles etc. Excellent product I had earlier purchased books from same publication but single units at a time. I was hoping for similar quality when I ordered in this collection. But it turned out to be a total disappointment, the binding is extremely poor and doesn\\'t look like its going to last long. The thickness of the pages are also not upto the mark. The finish overall is poor Size of book is small so my 17 month lo can handle it easily.pictures are realistic.corner of book are round so no worry of hurting.box was little damaged but books were in excellent condition.worth the money.loved it. Excellent set of books, my son likes a lot. We are actually happy with the quality of the print, paper etc.. One improvement could be the selection of articles , may be little more indianized for a real-life experience with their learnings. That does not stops me giving 5 star👍👍👍 Hi Dear,- Much Needed for Starting of 3 years old  child.- Quality is too good- Attractive colors with Pictures.- My openion it\\'s too small need to increase  size of books.- Well collections with 10 books.- Totally Nice. Oh God !!!!my baby loves to see the images and she can even identify some images and make sound that she knows it before, I can\\'t Express those in words Excellent quality and beautiful illustrations. My 2 year old daughter loves it, so does my wife. The only drawback I can say is some of the fruits, vegetables and animals shown in the books are not very common in our country. Overall it is very good gifting option if you have a young child. The quality of pictures in the book is very poor. Also the cover is of very poor quality. My 10 months  son just put the book in his mouth once and the cardboard particles started coming out of cover. Didn\\'t expect quality to be so bad. Even the cardboard box in which this book was delivered was of better quality than book. The product is of average quality. After a few days of use the edges of the book are getting easy damaged. Purchased similar product with better quality with same price. Product is good but instead of 10 board books, i received  only 8 and the cover was damaged.Different set received which  is not mentioned  in the list These books are so helpful in the early learning days! At first I’ve got misprinted book. What an amazing customer service and prompt return and replacement! Satisfied and happy customer. great size n weight for a 1 year old to hold in their own hands. Photo quality is good but some choices could have been better. Will definitely order 2nd set soon too Got it for 449 hard strong can be brought for 1+ kids.it has suffered a lot under my kid but u can stick pages.has a lot of content and clear images of things just perfect for 1+ kid It\\'s very small in size. That\\'s is the only thing I felt bad.But it\\'s is useful to kids to start learning and helps them to make  familiar of basics. ohh it\\'s too good for kids, specially for younger kids as young as 2 years. Due to covid situation I am not able to send them to pre school but these book are very helpful and worthy. The best part is quality of each book are good and children will love and learn. Book cover and each pages are laminated and nice look.I highly recommend this little library. We ordered it as a gift to child on her birthday. The product is packaged well..which makes it a nice guft and the quality of the paper snd cardboard used is also very good...durable for rough handling. All the books are very attractive. Images give real feel of animals etc. My 10 months old baby enjoys a lot. He spends a lot of time on these books. Good learning for babies. Though the books are easy to use, (corners are soft etc.) by small babies, but still they can torn if used regularly. Then there are chances they might put or swallow small paper parts of book in their mouth. So keep an eye. Otherwise books are very good. Not value for money.Babies get board very soon with one thing.So basically its for elder babies (certainly they don\\'t need this, they are elder).So overall it\\'s very costly. loved it. my daughter likes to play with it(shes just 9months). but she likes to turn the pages and look at pictures.  we are reading with the wild animals book and her animals simultaneously and she loves it. The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n            \\n                \\n            \\n        \\n    \\n    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    \\n  \\xa0All 9 out of 10 books quality is good.1 book is torn a bit at bottom(photo attached) ..hard enough but to be careful not to be contact with water or saliva(kids). Liked the quality and reality of the picture. Did not like the wrong depiction of leaves in some fruits. Would be better if the same pictures are not repeated in different books. It is experienced many time that item seen in the picture over AMAZON portal, does not match with actual product.  This time this library book set is like a pocket diary. I have purchased it for a 2 year kid but could not happy after purchase. Very nice and attractive. Kids will love it. So compact and easy to hold. No sharp corner edges of the book so it\\'s easy for the kids to play and it won\\'t hurt them. Just go for it. Advisable for all the the tiny tots of age 1-5 Let me clear, Please check the 3-4-6 product image before guessing it\\'s size. In 1 image it\\'s looks like big but it\\'s not,Also in number book number are small and objects are bigSame in colour book black looks like brown and orange looks like yellowProQuality of Book is too good I just ordered this My first library box set for my daughter\\'s first birthday. It\\'s cute little thing and good one to start with to keep your kids engaged and to make them to get familiarise with alphabets, animals etc. The big and bright pictures attracts the kids. Over all a good product. My baby\\'s first reaction to see this.. WowIt is very useful for kids n very worth in this price, it\\'s hard cover can keep it long but if you have more naughtiest kid then it can use for 3 months too as attached the pictures are after 8 months but good thing is that now my 23 months old baby knows various animals n learnt all colour ,shapes, a to z, 1 to 10, and he knows the difference between farm n wild animals, and amazing thing is that he doesn\\'t habbit of mobile tab or any other gadgets a. Book size is not more than playing card. Really disappointed with the size of the book. See attached picture.b. Quality is really good.c. No of page is 10 in the book.d. In the Number book, Numbers given 1 to 20 only. Limited content available.e. My 4 years baby all ready knows more than given in these books. So, more suitable for more younger kids. I purchased this for my 2 years old baby. This product is great for starting. Quality of pages are awesome and pages are kind of made of thick cardboard type paper and also safe for small kids to use. I would recommend this personally. 1. At first impression, the books were really small in size.2. Pictures are clear. These books contain pictures that are relatable and are easy to speak and learn. E.g. C for cat ( not crab)3. As parent,I am not stressed that these books can be torn by the child.this is a big plus for me. You will be surprised that these books are for our dog. It has stopped him from tearing up the girl\\'s homework. And sometimes I do find him looking at the pictures. Those books are very useful for kids upto 5 years. Every book contains only 10 pages of 10 big colourful real images with names. The only drawback is that some pictures or images are repeated in the pages of different books. This is very good product. My little one learned a lot from this item. She herself brings a book and asks me to teach which is really a good sign. So I would recommend this product to any mom. This is an excellent program for kid. Quality is good. Only thing I would like that it should have Indian touch in it, rather than US. For example it should have Indian fruits , Indian vegetables, Indian vehicles, Indian pets etc in it. Also ‘Bhindi’ should be ‘Lady Finger’ , not Okra Its a great product for kids who have just started to learn. The quality of the books was good. The size was a bit small though. My 1.5 years old baby live the books. Quality of pages, picture print, attractive colors used in books inside nd outside for kids, because of small in size it is easy to hold it in my baby’s hand nd turn over the pages. He can roughly use it without a worry of damage. Awesome product. Even my child learn 4-5 new things only in one day. They are very good. Toddlers will easily recognise and learn things with playing. It’s good to introduce first to toddlers. Quality wise very good.If you think to buy it thn definitely go for it. Ideal for 1-2 year olds. Though some items on book are difficult to pronounce for a 2 year but eventually he would learn it as the pictures are vivid. I bought it for my toddler for my 10 months old infant. Loved it from day one. Asks me to read all the 10 books like flash cards in one sitting for twice a day. After few months when he started speaking he himself identified,read it without any help. He it pulled it to pieces due to over usage. So planning to rebuy the same set again Some words is highly difficult to pronounce to elders thn how abt kids?I think this cud hve been better if it is as simple as. Now feeling it is waste. My sister visited us with a toddler niece. I gifted this book set to her and she loved it. These are first set of books for my niece and she got hooked to turn and play with it immediately.Recommend it if you are looking to introduce books to toddlers. Its very nice product. Got delivered in 24 hrs. It was valentine gift for my toddler. Books r really good for toddlers, color, quality, all good n at reasonable rate. My little one loved it! Pictures were very detailed and covered all major categories. She flips the pages on her own drawn to it by the attractive pics. The only drawback is that toddlers less than 2 years who tend to put everything in mouth, easily make it wet and it gets torn at the corners. Wonderful Board books for kids which engages them most of the time. I got it for my 1 yr old kid , he enjoys seeing pictures. Quality is too good. Won\\'t tear that much easily. Awesome colours and prints . Highly recommended Love this hard cover book for my 1 year old she loves to pretend read and it’s good for my 4 year old also he can read and spell all the names Good quality, durable product. Our daughter lives the stack of books. Page quality is very good. No fear of cut and bruise from the books. Color is also good. Bought it for Rs.379 as a promotional offer. You may check the current price & afford it. My son really happy when he saw the booklet. Printed in thick sheets. Really awesome.. And images printed somewhere twice.. Overall it\\'s a good educational book to refer kids below 3 yrs.. My kid loves this set. Only thing that can be improved is the size.And please don\\'t teach P for Pizza to kids from this age, not advisable These books are very cute and useful...good quality and content..my 16 months girl is very engaged with these books. Size of one books is w3.5/ h4 inches. The only drawback is the box witdh is a little less that the books fits very tightly inside and my baby couldn\\'t pull out the book by herself untill I help her. So my suggestion is to wonder house books please increase box witdh a little so the toddlers can put and take out the books easily from the box. Books are too small than expectations...felt very odd to make our child understand from such a small content. It\\'s a common sense that Babies generally love to have much bigger size which attracts them easily ...color is good otherwise... Overall disappointed. It\\'s a good set of 10 books.Pro: Every thing except oneCons: Images in the book should be picked from life around baby. Example: \\'B\\' stands for \\'Bear\\' which is rare for a baby to relate. It could be \\'Book\\' or any othe item which is relatable for a baby. Quality of books are nice..card is not too strong..I got 10 books for 499.that is 50 rs per book..not worth of 50 rs per book..anyway my 3yr old kid loves those books soo much which makes me satisfied.. It\\'s great for 2+ kids my son enjoys holding them coz it\\'s very small in size and can be easily fit in his hand but only problem is he didn\\'t like alphabet book as it have one alphabet on each page but on last two pages 8 alphabet are written due to which he loose interest in them. Our 15months baby was able to tear off the pages in couple of days. The quality is below average and glue sticking the pages needs to be of higher quality. Kindly improve the product than fooling customers. Nice collection of introductory board books for toddlers. My 3 month old loves gazing at the pictures. Value for money. Are these books for ants? I thought these would be normal sized books. They\\'re absolutely too tiny for a child to comfortably hold and lack enough content lot more to learn for babies ..my nine months puts it inher mouth which is not safe so giving it to her only after she turns a year..overall good .. its very useful for toddler It\\'s one of the best books basically what I noticed is it\\'s been published for selling in USA and same is being sold in India may be due to Covid ...anyways ...The books are of hard cover. My baby cannot fold or tear pages and it\\'s very small and compact .It has glossy plastic coating making the books sort or water resistant  .It\\'s a buy recommended from my side .Thanks My daughter loves these books. She get excited whenever i show her these books.The pages are thick , so kids cant easily tear. Must try. The images are pretty clear too. This is one of the best things I\\'ve bought for my kid. We\\'ve been using it for almost 2 years and condition is prettty good. My son isn\\'t 3 yet but now knows names of shapes, colors, etc. I am glad that i purchased this book. Perfect size,  perfect quality,  perfect content. Good books.. attractive pictures and colours. Box was bit torn from corners. Quality of books is good. Size is too small but handy!! The quality of the board book was realky good. The image quality is also good. My kid loved this. Very hany in kids hand. Would highly recommend this. Product is really good, same as shown in the picture, it keeps my 1 year old busy and engaged for sometime.drawback i see is the size is bit small but it fits in toddlers hands perfectly so its also fine...overall a good purchase at this price Just go for it. My baby is 1.8yrs old and she is just enjoying it and playing with it. edges are fine. books are small but enough for little one. Overall a very good library to begin the world of learning for your little one. As Small as hand of a Normal Adult,The child Carries It Easily it his Hand,The Quality of pages is good,Helps to build vocabulry In little ones,Go for it without thinking Twice😃 I give it a 5 star because it is the best thing u can gift to ur 2 year old child. Books are small handy for child. Quality of books are very nice. Child can not easily tear them. And of course the cover that u get with this set of book is the cutest. It keep the books assembled and easy to access. Product quality is good..Image displayed in the website looks too big.. however you have mentioned dimension details.By seeing image, it overwrites dimension details & our mind things product will be bigger in size. Good trick.Over all.. its tine as mentioned 10cm & 9cm..kids will love it Very good quality of print, paper and colors.  Content printed could be better(I mean easy to spell and more familiar things from around us )for a beginner  as it is for a kid who didn\\'t start school yet Loved the books my 3 year old is in live with themThe size is small so they fit perfectly in his little handsAnd the pages are sturdy and easy to turn Product quality is good but some books might not required as first library like wild animals instead of that it should be human body parts. Its a good collection of books.I got this for my baby when he was 4 months.But the pictures are not so bright so it will be good only for babies above 7 8 months i guess.Its a normal book .. not touch and feel once. My kid is loving it like a candy....beautiful colours...hard bound and tiny size makes it a perfect book with amazing pictures for a lil kid .... absolutely worth it prize Build quality is very good and all the books are well designed for learning of small children. American English is used to define many animals so some names are never heard of. Got it on deal. Books part of the full set are duller in colour, have different font and are less attractive to baby when compared to individually bought books. everything about these books are very good; except the size. they are very small, like three inches max. Overall satisfied with the product but the only minus point is the size of it. Would have been better if the size would have slightly bigger. My little one loves it. The pictures are very clear and books are just of right size for my baby to hold and explore. Amazing product with plenty of education in one box.  My kids loved it and learns most of the things from it. It’s a good box set of board books. Slightly smaller than I expected but good quality of the box and the books. The pictures are nice and clear. Bought it in the sale for 399 which was good. The full price might be a little more for this set. Its really good product for kids. The quality is really nice..Although my kid doesnt study yet he loves to play with it.Must buy at this price. Its a good start for child of age 1.5 and above, manufactured to withstand heavy drop by kids and has good list of items to teach kids.4 stars because I need my child to learn what is there in my country and things that we can show them in real in near future. but some of thee items are of European and American It is a matter of fact that younger children have habits to tear things apart. But the material that these book are made up of is great specially kept in consideration. I brought so mamy book but noone last more than 2 3 dayz.i found pages all over the room.but these are amazingly good.must buy Exactly the right size for tiny hands. Very few mistakes are there. My child enjoyed it so much that I now gift it to other friends as well. It\\'s very small in size. Size is different from given in description. The size of total box is 12.4×10.2×9.3 cm. instead of 20×14×4 cm. HandyGood qualityGood thicknessEasy to engage a toddlerMy baby loved it :-)Thank u Amazon Good quality item. Nice packaging. Thanx amazon. But few books glue sticking is not proper. Book detached from front cover. Very good set for early learning. It has a compilation of 10 books on fruits, vegetables, transport, colors, alphabets, etc and very good pictures. Apt for 9months + kids. Very useful and keep my 1year old baby so busy.. really worthy.. will buy again for my nephew.. thanks seller My son is 2.6 and his almost done knowing everything in these books! If there’s something I would never regret buying for my son will be this box of books! Awesome book...print is very gud...bright and clear words and pictures..My two years daughter likes it too much... I ordered this set for my 2 year old daughter..and she loved it..the images shown in the book are very attractive and appealing to be learnt by a kid...since the pages are made of hard board so they are not tearable , which is best part ,since it is to be given to a kid ..a good option to reduce screen time for my girl I bought it for my kid for self learning and teaching some basic stuff from home. My kid is very much interested in this books and learnt most of the contents. Highly recommended.The making quality of the book is also very good. Excellent set of books. Perfect for 1.5 year old to learn. Product quality is good. Pages are thick. Though I was reluctant to buy because of small size... but after buying I realised ...my lil one can hold these books properly and turn pages. This set is favourite of all the books I have. A good set of books. Keeps the lil one interested. It is also a good option for gifting someone. Would certainly recommend it. Value for money. Awesome collection. By 2.3 year old baby is totally in love with the collection. Being bright colored , carrying single picture in each page and big font size, it attracts my toddler a lot and she carries the collection where ever  she goes. five star After seeing the reviews I bought but I am not happy with the books. Quality  is good but content is not up to the mark. Alphabets  are small and images are  small. I bought these for my 10month baby so that he enjoys and learn alphabet. Color book doesn’t show color and alphabet book shows only images not alphabet. My 2 and half year old baby loves it.....so many new things to explore...n the quality is really nice with vibrant colors that attract 👍👍👍 I bought the same for my elder daughter and buying the same for my younger one. But the choice of pictures could better like too much towards kids. The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n            \\n                \\n            \\n        \\n    \\n    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    \\n  \\xa0Product is okay, if I give it my baby she will definitely tear it. And books are very tiny.But overall its good. I purchased this set of books in Oct 2020 in 399. The best thing about this product is vibrant colors which attracts kid towards them again and again. Another good feature is its quality of paper and sturdiness. I believe that this is the must have library one should have.

If you want your baby spare your mobile phone and engage in learning activity then this is complete package. Beautiful set of little books with amazing pictures. My son only uses them for stacking them perfectly even with the last fitting so well. He\\'s just obsessed to keep them clean and well stacked. 😄 I gifted it to girl child, She\\'s 1 year old but she grabbed it and started looking one by one. Also she try to talk by making some sounds. Her parents are Happy  found it more useful for her. It may help her before she join Nursary. AND BEST THING IS THESE ARE BOOKS NOT THE SCREEN OF MOBILE.  Good set of books, Untierable At first we got defective product due to some book covers torn out. Later the replaced product came intact.Must have book set for the kids. We really love this little library for my nephew. The pages are hard which cant be torn apart easily and the texture of the paper is very smooth & edges are great. I like these books very much. Good Material is used for pages and cover of the book. Very colorful. My 1 year old son loved it. Size and books are as per description. Value for money. One star is less because some books have two alphabets in single page instead of one on each page. It makes the picture smaller. It is a great collection...initially when I received the parcel, I was a little taken back that the size of the books are so small...was expecting bigger ones..but my kid loves it because it is very handy for him to hold and turn pages...quality of the pages is also good ..and one page has one picture so child can concentrate easily...definitely worth the buy..Truly its wortht of 1st library Very good quality books.Lots of pages and high quality printing.Wasn’t expecting this quality at the current price.Great buy for my little one! Material is strong and looks like it lasts in the hands of a hyper active toddler. Books are Compact with bright pictures. Really worthy at this cost It\\'s Cool. Recommended. Amazing, I bought this in 499. My baby happy to see this small library. I never saw him excited as today after seeing books. Amazing, increase knowledge n leaning power of your kid. Must buy. Five out of five. In certain books like alphabets...the pictures a re bigger than the letters which is confusing for the child Books are of very good quailty, content is very good  and size is apt for small kids. Pages are like sheets and very thick. I never expected it to be so good.Would say a must buy for pre school kids.I bought it for ₹399 Very much satisfied product....my daughter likes it very much....love the product best value for money...must buy...thank u amazon for such a wonderfull base of learning...everyone should buy...size is ok clarity of images are very good and atteractive😍😍😍...Very useful.....Thank you...♥️♥️♥️ The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n            \\n                \\n            \\n        \\n    \\n    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    \\n  \\xa0Best book ever.. very informative and non tearablePerfect for toddlers My son is in complete love wit these books..he jst feels happy looking at the pics.

My son is taking interest and learning about new things.You also have to get engage for good response. Quality of the product is good.Content of the product is just okay. For example, in the colours book, it showed a red apple, which is also in the alphabets book. So, I felt the content should have been much better. I bought this almost an year back when my kid was 7 months old. She thoroughly enjoyed all the 10 books. Excellent for my toddler. Very good quality and good material inside. This looks good as books are inside a box which is also good. Books Smells of solvent adhesive used for pasting the pages. Not so safe for babies. Manufacturers should consider this & use safer raw materials while manufacturing this product as they know this will be used by infant babies who are very sensitive to any chemical smell. বাচ্চাদের উপযোগী বই। সাইজে একটু ছোটো হলেও দেখতে সুন্দর এবং পৃষ্ঠাগুলিও মোটা হওয়াতে মজবুত। তবে পশুপাখি বা অন্যান্য উদাহরণগুলিতে ভারতীয় পরিবেশের নমুনা অধিক গ্রহণ করলে শিশুরা মনেহয় বেশি সুবিধা পাবে। একইসঙ্গে ইংরেজি ছাড়া বাংলা বা অন্যান্য ভাষাতেও এমন কাজ অনলাইন কেনাকাটায় সহজলভ্য হলে মন্দ হয় না ব্যাপারটা। Very nice set of books.according to size it\\'s very handy and comfortable for kids.and curves aren\\'t sharp.abd font size , picture quality is also good.easy to carry when going in traveling or somewhere out.my baby is enjoying by seeing these books. Very nice collection! My 1YO loves it ❤️The book collection contains all basic books with attractive pictures.Good packaging. Liked it. Price also reasonable. Just that the colours could have been shown in some shape, instead of different objects, for a baby to understand better. Otherwise it is awesome, as a baby\\'s first book. Wonderful gift for kids !!! Thoroughly enjoyed  the books . They’re perfect size and best books to get kids started with. A good refresher for adults as well !!! Have ordered the pack 2 already and awaiting its arrival eagerly !!! Super item. Good appearance of pictures. It is very easy to learn for kids. Only i disappointed books are very small. My 1.5 kid handling book like soap box. Great product....I bought it for my 8month old kid. He loves to watch it,I used it as a flash card l. Very colourful and attractive collection, your little one is going to love this gift. Worth every penny 💰 Good quality material and printing...though my kiddo just enjoys moving  the books in and out of the box as of now...😄 Good for kids. I bought it when my daughter 22 months old and within 2 month she learned most of the images with name. I found it interesting  as kids learn fast with images whether its animals or fruits and vegetables. Its a great collection. The board book quality is pretty good and doesn’t get bent or torn easily. Bright colors and high quality images keep the kids entertained. My son loves all the books and keeps turning the pages over and over again. The pahes are quite thick.Quality is good.The edges have been rounded up so its safe.Colors are bright hence catchy for the kids.All good!!! Dont buy this product.. Many pictures and words are not seen in my 32 years lifetime and now i purchase this this non sense book for my child. Not child friendly to turn pages. Because of singal picture per page, children\\'s can\\'t develop picture detection capabilities using this books. Card quality and lamination layer is not good. Winthing 2month my 1.5 year old tore most of the books. Not water proof too. Quality is very good. No sharp edges. No worry of these getting torn or damage if your baby decides to use it in their own ways. It\\'s good for giving your child a basic idea about general things in their early ages. I got the set but it\\'s very small in size I assumed before purchasing to be big size books atleast half of A4 Size but it\\'s like very small but good product would be useful for 12+ months Beautiful cute looking handy books for your little one. Such a nice product and durable that your child cannot tear it apart. 10 different books that makes your child reading, learning alphabets, colors, numbers, animals etc. day to day items and things they get to sharp their memory and increase vocabulary. Handsome packing, affordable price and worth for each paisa I paid. We are loving it. In Wild animals book..... Animals pictures are very scary... My baby got scared....It could have been better design My son is 3 years old and he likes this product. Its perfect! Small one but good in quality. Its a cute collection. Books are very well designed and colourfull. Delivery was on time.  I highly recommend this. Must buy The contents are perfect and relevant to age but content is foreign and not found in Indian households. These books are must buy for kids.my baby loves these books from the age of 6 months till now . pictures are very clear and big enough .these books really helps kids to learn about different animals birds numbers etc. it\\'s all in one pack.go for it The books are of good quality,colorful and my 1 and half yr old loves it. It is amazing for gifting purpose as well. However, items included could be more Indianized as many of the animals and others are not even seen in India. So 4 stars for that. It\\'s of good quality but the size is too small for a toddler to gain his attention. Good set of books. Price is Ok. May find on cheaper Rates in the book stores. Very good under 3 years kids.Size and the quality are amazing for kids and it is definitely first kids library 👌.10 variety of books have valuable information. Delivery was prompt, however the set was missing a \"farm animals\" book and a \"fruit\" book repeated twice, going to returns and reorder.Hopefully, correct set would arrive next time. Quality of the pages and print seems good. Product is good, bad quality board paper. Dissolves in a second. A baby puts every product in mouth. As soon did this to the book, half book desolbed I have purchased the item for 499. I liked the books. The books are colourful and sturdy. My nephew also liked it. I would say it is indeed a good purchase. The best of the book is, the kind of paper has been used in this book.As usually, Kids used to play with the books and sometimes they used to tear it.but the plastic paper strength the durability of this product. Nice books, it\\'s a little small but worth the price. Also checked other books for kids of this age. The size of the other books are also same. so felt it a good purchase. Quality of Books are good. A little small in size though, about 4 x 4 inches page. Good quality books. Made of hard cardboard so chances of tearing is minimal. Colourful pictures captures kids interest in this. My 16 months old is already loving it. Amazing set of books.  Must buy for babies and toddlers.  My10month baby loves looking at the clear pictures,  easy to hold, the pages are thick card board and won\\'t tear easily I didn\\'t buy it from Amazon, but it\\'s very good product to help children reading, my boy liked it very much, he will ask me to show all the books once before going to sleep gave me a good impression looking at the pictures. after receiving, its a disappointment.too small Nice books, strong and water proofMy baby like it, and play by identifying Worth it!! Just make sure the kid does not place the books in his mouth or spill water on it. Gets soiled too soon. Just this point apart, the product is good to go. Make sure you are around the baby during the reading time. 👍👍 After searching more than 20 product I feel this product is perfect for 2-3 year child.Quality of product was very good.Little high in price but value for money.. Best books for growth development in babies. Brought it for my 4 month old, she enjoys watching the pictures and bright colours. Very good books for your kid to start with.. pictures are very clear and my boy just loved it. Educative books ,more engaging books for kids ,helps in fast learning for kids ,good product quality Not worth the price. The size of the books are too small. Fits in an adults palm. Each page has got only one picture. Content is not upto the mark. And the seller is a cheat not allowing return of the item. This set should be priced around rs 99 instead of Rs 399. Good books for kids 2-3 yrs old. Fun playing n reading along with parents. Small size helpful in carrying around Excellent product. My baby had a lot of fun learning from the book set. It helps us to avoid using mobile phone to show her things. She loves to stack the books in the box as well so keep the box safe after you receive it . Those who expect more quality can choose these books.They look really worthy..We liked them I am amazed that box onky has the capacity of 9 books. I noticed it has 9 books only. 1 farm animals and pets book is not with the set. . Box itself says 10 books. Where is the place to keep 10th book? Deferent way to teach your baby , baby also takes interest if he/she having variety of learning stuff.. Well the kid really likes the book as these are colourful with pictures. I believe it will help my daughter to pick up things in a quicker way. Books were made with good quality. It is very useful for the newborn babies. I bought for my one year old daughter and she loved it. Go for it! stop putting emphasis on how your children look on the outside. start making the beautiful on the inside. This is very useful for learning basics for a kid. If you want to give a gift to any little on this is the best choice. Maine av tak use nai kiye hai bcoz mere baby bhut chota hai but i like it bhut accha yeh baby kch new sikhne ke lye maine 2 set liya hai Excellent collection for kids to start learning for them at home before putting them to play schools however I got this for 499 and Flipkart is selling the same product for 280 rs Very clear and big pictureNice research on each n every topic here.Good collectionOnly issue i gave less rating i bought it at 499 now available at 399.

I have kick off my reading habit to my 8 months old baby with this set.He is listening while I\\'m showing and reading these books. Worth to buy. Please definitely go ahead. My boy is 10th months old . This small board book fits perfectly in his lil hands to see different pictures . Atleast trying to get them off your phone and television . Could have been better if the print quality and colour is improved. Other wise just does the job. good quality board book with attractive bright colours and relevant photos. Can buy for toddlers.. easy to turn pages for the little ones Very good books.  They are binded properly for rough usage by small kids.  The colors and pages are very good.  Note that only 20 or so one side pages per book.  The books come with a hard case to keep them together. Best for 1+ kids.. great quality of book and picturesWorth for money.. my niece loved it. She just one year old and she enjoys watching pictures.Must buy The quality and size of the books are good, only thing is these are canadian products and so some of the pictures are difficult for Indian kids to understand as they are not of Indian origin.Overall i would rate it as good.

It’s very helpful for my 2 year old son. He readily identifies the pictures shown in the books. The quality is very good and is very much recommendable for toddlers. My son uses it very roughly still the books are in tact. At this price it is very good buy. Along with this, a book of Hindi-Alphabet must also be there, and at the same time the pictures used in these should be taken according to Indian origin, culture and circumstances and not foreign... Awesome My 1 year old learned a lot and still enjoying these books Good product.....one thing is missing....basic animals like elephant, tiger, lion are not in any of the book My niece loves it so much. Trust me your kids won\\'t let go of these once they have it. Nice collection of books for the small one!! My kid loves it and learning with this makes interesting and interactive. Go for it for your small ones as they gonna like it. Very much exited about this product, perfect for kids... The quality and contents are prefect. Best first library for kids starting with age 1.5-2 Not very colorful and too small pictures, which is a major drawback considering its a book for babies. Best for beginners. Keeps baby engaged and it\\'s great fun to identify objects around baby There should be more pages and pages might be slightly thinner Packaging was good,though size of the books are smaller, should have in  little bigger in size. Children can learn things from it. Learn to recognize things. Still I would say it is way overpriced at Rs 499. Should have come at Rs 200-250 Very good books but one star less as the books need to be sturdier and some of the birds fruits ect are more international than Indian which  you wod want the kid to learn as well.Overall good product Awesome bookset....In this Covid period good option for home schooling for 3 to 4 years kid...My kid is enjoying it...Good quality and hardness of pages so that kids wont fold it... It\\'s more than what U expect. It\\'s very good. Very nice pictures and very good quality books. A must hv, if U hv a toddler at home. It\\'s lk their own little library. Thank You. Lovely set of books to teach kids about various types of colours animals etc. good production values and nice colours The books are must have and have attractive  images.However the cost do not do justification.I had gone to normal book store and got hard bind and a large book in the same price range. I bought these for my kids as their first books and they are really happy.. My only complaint is if they were slightly bigger in size it would have easier for kids to handle They are colorful good and sturdy....really good....go for it A great addition to the beginning of my little baby\\'s Library. Nice book and good to understand. But size is too small.The size should be quite large. Quality is not good, kids tear next days easily.Page quality good but binding & outer cover not attached properly.Otherwise all good. Too small books... not worthy for kids...Although stuff used is very good and have good educational knowledge. Good Product and worth the cost. The only set back being that it\\'s not water proof and tears off very easily when water is accidentally dropped on it. It would have been great if it had been water proof. The quality of the board books are just woww. Clear and colorful pictures attracts toddlers.My lil daughter loved it but as it was a gift for my nephew its gone now.. but m gonna buy it again.. Nice pocket books, good quality prints. Could have been better if designed with Indian perspective then US, so that kids can relate better and faster. The books contain a variety of pictures which are very attractive. Only concern is that the books are too small in size. Average Product. Because some picture word is incorrect. Some words are not easy to learn kids.... Very small books pocket type, total waste of money. You can chose other type books from local market in appropriate size. I lost my 400 Rs. due to offer advantage. Overall it’s good, print quality is really goodReduced 1 star as in abc book E&F is missing So sturdy and excellent size for baby hands. She loves looking at it all the time and learned so many words . Value for money it is. Returned the product as it is damaged. Amazon didn\\'t post my original review. So I\\'m editing it as per Amazon requirements Easy to use. 9months old holding and turning easily. Highly recommended. Good quality.. Pocket size . Value for money impressive demonstration The book is small size which makes easy to hold it by toddler n hard enough which r not easily tearable by babies. Book has colourful pictures which creates interest in kids. Totally awesome product with affordable price. Loved it. Excellent set of small books with rounded edges, and thick pages and very clear print !! Strongly recommended !!! Small cute books, kids can hold the books very easily and they will love it. Picture colours are too attractive, really babies will enjoy with it. Too good! Must buy for your toddler… my son loves going through all the books! This is my first set of books for my 10 month old. The quality of the books are excellent. Pictures are very colourful. My baby enjoys looking at different pictures. Overall a great purchase. Quality, value for money and must have for starter..Awesome quality of paper ..Kid loved it. Nice product contains everything you need to teach in early days ... Completely happy with product... Small books for my 1 year old. Easy for him to handle. Though expected it to have thicker pages, it still can be maintained. The picture makes one feel the book is large but the size is like a pocket calendar, please don\\'t buy, it\\'s simply fooling the customer. I bought it for my sister\\'s daughter. She really enjoys reading from small books which are suitable for her age. Quality of books are pretty good. Great set of books for kids. It is a board book and includes basic knowledge for kids. I like this product but the words are not easy to learn like that B for ball is very easy for childrens to learn but the bear is very difficult to learn and then colours are not clear cut to understand the children . My one year old loved it. Looks very small but it is worth as she enjoyed to the core Good qualityPerfect size for kidsThe box is super helpful to stack the booksClear and beautiful pictures and lettersCovers almost every important images on each topic. Good but small..we expect little bit biggerSo please check the dimensions before buy Nice book..My little niece like it so much...hard page and good quality image. This highly recommend for 1+ year child, no doubt cost to little bit high, but your child will enjoy with graphics photos and learn Size of the book is small and easy for kids to hold. E for Eggs and N for Nest is confusing, because in Nest there are Eggs in the picture. Quality is very and value for money. Very nice product.. Useful for children from 1-4 years.. Main intention is to familiarize them with the picutres in it, not that to make them understand what actually it is..good quality books and pictures. Everything they show is not local. Starting from fruits to animals. The pictures of Cantaloupe, and some other things. How on earth, toddlers are going to pronounce cantaloupe. This is the fundamental flaw. Its not that useful. Very nice collection for babies ,picture size is also good and clear makes it interesting for others too. Lovely collection but the book dimensions could have been a little bigger for easy handling by kids . A good set of books for your kid. The page quality is good for rough handling. Kid loved it.

Otherwise all are good Best choice for 3-4 year babies..my daughter loved it.. the pictures are big and colourful.. it hard bind pages..so not afraid that kids may tear it.. excellent choice for the basic learning from home.. 29 month kid loving it. If picture quality improved would be good. Kid recognizes items from book but when sees the object live for first time cant recognize. Ordered next of 20 books. Kid too happy. My little girl is so obsessed with these books, she is having great time learning. In less than a month of period she has started to recognize the words, colors, numbers. I am so glad that I brought this. We introduce  living animals etc... & non living  things to our children , grand children .This books including colourful pictures with great quality its v.useful for small children below three years Its a really good product for kids. My kid is 7 months old and whenever I show him one of these books he really enjoys. Though I dont know much he understands, but he loves to go over the content of these books. The Product was good with images, color etc.. Set of 10 books... But the size of the book was little bit small.. So it will be easy for babies to carry... Nice and colourful one for the kids to learn easily... The size of book is quiet Smaller than I expected. Quality is good though.. Could have been a little tall book set...tiny books, though looks okay...haven\\'t opened as it is for gifting...looks cute. My kid love this books. He is of 18 months and love to see the pictures and now he could say the names of animals with its image. Very much recommended.. Must buy product. Very much suitable for 4 to 5 year old kids. Very facinating .child loves to read it. Very creative development for kid. Love it. Must try for kids Superb, an excellent & quality product, would recommend it. The collection and paper quality is really nice .. my baby loves it. There is no petroleum smell and dont have Idea about the ink quality Best books, quality wise, knowledge wise thumbs up! Keeps my toddler busy. My baby is very naughty and he used to tear every study material. However, this one is so strong that he couldn\\'t tear it. It\\'s durable with good printing and nice look. You can go for it. The size is small but child can easily carry it. And that’s enough. Pages are of nice material. Pictures are colorful. Superb! So much colorful and quality is also fine thick pages and clear images I bought this for my 10 month baby.. he open book and points at some figures and pretend like he is reading 😂😉 quality is good but. same things are repeating in other book Must buy for infants n toddlers....good quality The pages are not thick and easily torn. Could be better Too good. It\\'s images help the children to memories. It\\'s look amazing. It is best for 2-5 yrs old kid. It’s a great product to start with 2year olds .. good quality and prints are very clear .Happy with purchase ❤️ Awesome books and quality is good. Can carry in your purse too to take it anywhere and its a long term study books even 1st standard students can read them well for perfect knowledge like shapes transport animals etc price worthy item love it u should buy Cover and pages are quite sturdy.But - as this product is meant for some western country, one can\\'t find many ndian things in the books though these are easily available everywhere.So Difficut to correlate for kid. I went to many stores to purchase books for my little one.But the books I found costed 300 per book and didn\\'t had much attractive pics in it.I found that this is the best set for my little one and is of just 400 and has attractive pics. Very well designed and quality is very good! Size is just right for kids. My son already loves it. For this price (Rs.399) it is really worth it! Too costly !!! Not really worthy with repeated  images in different books Hard cover, thick sheets, size of ur passport.The initial pages got  one image per page, and  the last few pages got multiple images per page, My Son really loved these books, hard once very clear n nice product Very appropriate for young ones. Durable and interesting books. My nephew loved these books and when read out the images. He tried tearing the pages but they are strong enough to withstand a baby\\'s curiosity. It\\'s an amazing product my toddler loves it has nice and colorful pictures and the book size is another great feature as it\\'s easy for the young hands to hold and also easy to turn over the pages. Same objects different pictures are printed. Child getting confuse on this. Number book has numbers in little font than picture. Child couldn\\'t recognise the number. Always going with the picture. My baby likes all the books present in the set. Very strong to tear into pieces. Great collections its small in size but for kids very handy every parent should buy this highly recommended Pictures are clear and the books are really useful to teach the kids. The kids can understand the pictures and easily figure out them as they look real. Must have product for your child. It will increase the knowledge of him/her in a drastical manner.Good quality. And your child even can\\'t eat because of good thickness.Very well managed and high quality product My 3 year old Son likes it and enjoys learning from this set of books Bought it for my 2 year old son and one year old nephew. Both of them equally loved it!! Very good set of books. A perfect gift for any kid in the age group of 1-3 yrs. Very good sturdy product. Only thing it\\'s smallnin size, slightly bigger than full palm. Otherwise all positive. Very helpful for kids.. material also very good Absolutely useful. My 1 year old baby liked and go through all pages. Paper is thick and book has the size and weight that a baby can hold.

I got it for my 15 year old baby . She liked it from beginning . Within 5-6 months she can identify all pictures and likes turning around pages . It keeps her engaged for quiet a lot of time.

You can actually keep your kids off screen for good amount of time. A must have for your lil one... Very cute n smart as well as informative... They are square palm sized books. My 10month can also hold it. Bright pictures. Good binding. I like the product. We gothrough the books together. This size of the book is made especially for 2-3 yrs kids for easy handling. This helps them to spend more time looking at the images and try learning. Colours are choosen carefully for easy remembrance. Products with similarities placed perfectly so that kids dont get confused Books are ok with good quality images... but they are small... kids loose interest on it... better to go for bigger books, as these will not serve the main purpose of teaching Good product but Not worthy.. you can buy bigger board book set in local shop for this price Size picturised in image seems big but these are tiny books we which seem to be expensive according to size and quality. Beautiful gift set. Got it for my nephew. He seems to like it. Great source of learning for kids. Keep it up guys! Just one thing to mention try to name simple things in first library, e.g B for Ball is more relevant than B for bear. Babies are just learning the new words so what they see can learn n spell easily. Rest book are awesome Quality even the holder is good. My one year old baby chews the pages easily. Quality of the pages should be improved bcoz babies have a tendency to bite everything. But for this price it is fine cute little books..strudy and handy for a kid..my kid love to put them inside the box.. good product my 1 yo kid loves them all...he reads all books day and night..keep asking me about every picture he sees...he is so curious about all of them..wonderful product...go for the buy This book i bought for my baby girl who is 7mnths old.. and she is attracted to the book and color... Soon she will start learn Books are simple and educative for kids. My 1.8yrs yrs old niece is already identifying the animals, fruits, vegetables etc around her by just remembering the images she has seen in the books.One star less for the late delivery and missing book on shapes. Quality is super ...first n for most it is MADE IN INDIA .👌👌👌..pakka local(prakash books published)....Happy for Boycott ing chaniess toys Good quality. Nice n useful product. Meets expectations.

My child love this first library. He learn so many things from the books. My 1yr baby girl likes all the books so much.She pretends to read.. 😆 Same as pics available on amazon, hard and thick paper with clear images. I really liked this Product..The packing was good and its an ideal playing as well as a learning kit for your Kid.If you are planning for you my recommendtion is go for it.Worth the money paid.

Must have in every home where u can engage ur kid for atleast an hour.worth the buy. Books are so handy for the kids and  safe since the pages are think and edges are rounded.

Its absolutely handy and easily manageable.Total worth it!!! My 2.5 year old kid loved the images. He can recognise A-Z and Numbers very easily.

The pictures are clear and make the kids to look into them.For a toddler as a pre school activity, buying this collection is worth and affordable!! Honestly I\\'m not happy that you guys a giving a diary sized books for 2 yr old kid..your images or product detail doesn\\'t mention that books are so small in size Paper quality is ok ok, still baby can tear them or cut them by teeth The size of books is very small.

It awesome mini library for kids Such an amazing collection of books for really small children. My nephew who is 1 year old loves the books and reads them at every meal. It is a great way to distract children yet educate them without getting them addicted to screens of TV/ Mobile Super quality as expected its helps children very much to learn alphabets numbers colours am very much satisfied with this product Tiny books are great for kidos, chotu chotu baby also loveto see the images inside. I bought it for my 3 year but my 1 years kidos also love yo to see them Nice product for toddlers Very clear pictures . The pages quality are very impressive as they are quite thick and doesn\\'t get easily  tampered by even rough handlers and information given is nice for a child . And my niece loves it Binding of the book is flimsy , as babies put every thing is the mouth can\\'t leave them with the book alone ... My baby tore it apart within a week.. Fantastic and useful for tiny tots and upto 3 years old children! Lovely little board books with beautiful pictures. Kids would love these. Value for money. Nice books and nice design It\\'s an amazing set of books. I ordered these for my 13 months baby. She loves to flip pages and enjoy pictures. One page has only one big picture and that\\'s the best part. Easy to carry. Loved the product. Grt collection for the new learners.Good images.And Nyc material used.Which a kid doesn\\'t damage Good quality with easy to understand details like pictures and colors. Books are very good quality and pictures are very clear. My kid loved it. I gave one less rating because on the abc book last letters (xyz) are missing and previous letters are repeated. Good collection of books..very handy Quality is good and sized right for less than 1 year child. I would recommend this as one of the first step if you wish your child to develop habit of holding books in hand. I’m not satisfied with the size.. overall it’s good The quality of product is awesome the only thing this books are very small these are mini books The books are good...the only book not in the list is that of body parts, which is very much needed Kids will tear it easily I have purchased it for my 7 month baby. She is very attracted to these booksGood qualityEasy to handle Good quality and good choice of topic. Hope size could be a slight more and items could have been much into Indian space. Good learning for preschoolers with best pictures Very handy books to teach preschoolers. Pictures are clear and vibrant which is very appealing for the toddlers Good quality,sturdy and cost effective....👌 In vegetables book, ladies finger mentioned as okra. Okra is Hindi word.

Vegetable book content are to be changed with easy one . Quite interesting and good for toddlers Good one for kids. But my toddler ate a page so don’t get for kids who tend to bite off random things. Wait and get once they mature Good Quality.Suitable for children aged 2 to 3 They sent me this package in which abc and colour book same print. Abc has colours printed and it is pasted upside down. Otherwise product ok. Toddlers like to play with their books, also learn from them. This is a very good product for that purpose. My kid like to play with his books. Quality of this product has compelled me to write first \\'positive\" review after being Amazon customer for past 13 years(from US).

Nice book with good colours and good To see A good purchase, the paper quality and the graphics are attractive and will endure a naughty baby 🤣 Quality of products is good and its also good for children to learn in the easy way.One Suggestion to seller that small and capital alfabet (i.e ABC Book) should be separate as child  seen both letter simultaneously and its creat confusion to child Content is good but it can be wet and torn by small kids. Being a kids items, it should been with water proof. All the books have spoiled due to water entry. Purchased for my daughter. She thoroughly enjoyed it Excellent gift for kids. My 2 year kids picked up first few alphabets very nicely. This was the 1st purchase of buying books online for my little one.

I have a naughty kid who keeps tearing her books. Thankfully these books are still safe. 😄 Books have very good quality pictures, bright colors. Childrens can\\'t tare it down easily, sturdy. Cute first books for 1-2 yrs old. My daughter loves looking at the pictures during her breakfast. Could be more colourful.. My Daughter loved the collection Books are good but the Amazon delivery guy gave it to bakery near my house without informing or calling us ,this has happened to my other products also , My son is leaning fast thank for providing this in amazon platform. Outer box should be more good and rugged Best product i have ever bought on amazon... Wonderful...my child really liked it... 10 out of 10 for this product All are good but if you are buying for 2-3yrs kids then choose some more colourful books. Very colorful and sturdy books. Small enough to keep in front of baby\\'s eyes, thus ensuring baby does not get distracted. Would definitely recommend. Lovely books, very expressive and self explanatory. They are tiny and that makes these super cute. My 18 month old is in love with these books. He is able to grasp all the words and identifies the pictures. It’s a great way to spend time with your little one. A great buy and completely worth the price! Nice books with pictures for toddlers to learn new things.Value for money. Good quality Books are really Good... My daughter has learned many things looking at the pictures and enjoys playing with them all day long.. The pages of the books are thick which cannot be easily bend. Got misprints in 2 or more booksMust check before send.

This is nice book set for kids who started recognizing things my daughter can recognize all the things in one month only great set of books Really super for kids Many people are saying that the books are small and not worth it but on box it\\'s written $19, in ruppes $19 is ₹1468 but on Amazon it only 400 . The quality of this product is very good too. The product is really good and pictures are bright in colour and my kid loves it. Size may be little bit bigger... For less than 36 months baby. Go for bigger size book and they will see big pictures to enjoy themselves. Worth buying...but we received damaged product, last page of alphabet booklet was missed.. Book looks old .I think someone has already used kind .after unboxing I am bit unhappy I have returned the product. Hard board satisfactory Nice one Worth for money. मेरी गुड़िया को अपनी पसंद की सभी बुक्स एक साथ मिल गई। इन बुक्स को दिन भर पढ़ती रहती है। बुक्स की क्वालिटी भी अछि है और बच्चों के हिसाब से कलरफूल है। Pictures are real (not cartoon) which is the beast part, also the quality is really good, it is thick cardboard like, which the child cannot tear.

       "'The book is nice and I bought it for my year toddler he enjoyed it and developed a liking for it by just asking him to bring his books he could signal for the library but after a month instead of looking at the books he started nibbling on it as the books are hardbound he was able to swallow the cardboard making the edges soggy I have to keep it away now I try interacting with him orally but somehow I want him to get acquainted with books The only thing I wish was if the books were washable It is as shown in image Quality of the book is good they are board books so not tearable Shapes vegetables transport  colors books cannot be used now as my daughter is just turning a year old but can be used later In the books for eg Animal books animals like llama in bird book emu

years old now still play with those books  Has learned many things Books are made of hard cardboard type paper Good for small kids as they have tendency to tear pages Its good If pages are made up of waterproof material Books are small in size but good quality picturesDue to its small size kids can handle them easily Nice start to reduce screen time for kids The concept is goodtopics r covered in a nice way only problem is that the pages arent that thickmy 1 half year old kid has easily folded its pages vertically on very first dayso slightly disappointed It is really nice product to help kids

gift but wish I had kept it for my kidBooks are small but perfect for toddlers to handle Big and bright pictures Perfect for new learnersWill definitely recommend it to friends I not open the sealed of book packing I noticed the book size is very small and think inner contentpicture will be also small that will recognizable by my kids brain she is suffering autism Thus I return it Im not going to lie They are small books but board books usually comes in this sizeFor the price point this purely is a gem in the categoryBest to get started This is super cool to initiate  nurture reading habits into our little ones Dont expect your tiny humans to show interest in reading at the very beginning Allow them to explore the colourimages first My 7 month old just loves to go through it for the vibrant colours The size of the books was very smallso small that it doesnt look like a book even It is the size of a floppy disk The picture given in the site of Amazon is very misleadingshows that the book is very bigmy 2 year old daughter plays with it as a toy as throws it away rather than reading itmoreover it doesnt not have a return policy in it I feel cheatedthe books that we get in footpath for 30 rs are better than thisi really  doubt how it got so good reviews Good quality real pics of day to day things good contrast usedEasy to hold for babiesReal images only one image per pageWwhich is a good thing no distraction for babyMy kido loves to reaad yyhem  play with them carry them around the house  a must buy Actually product quality is good but problem is in every picture their is similarity or repetition of pictures for eg in fruits u normally get to see fruits thats right but in numerical again fruits are repeated so the basic concern is grasping gets confusing for child as vocal sounds are different for same picture ie 1 numb you see one apple and so on so if that is being rectified the product can be eligible for 5 star Minor things but it has a huge impact These books are really good with colourful pictures These are board books means hard cardboard like books cannot be torn easily by kidsCaution if the kids throw the book on us it will hurt us badly😄 books are really good must buy for toddlers kids gets attracted To it Glad to have picked a cloudtail product for my babyExcellent as alwaysdelivered with perfectionno complaintssaved me time and money 💰I hope cloudtail and Amazon will be around when my baby grows up and begins to shop onlineThanks for everything These books are great Kid loves them and asks parents to read the books to him everyday It’s hard for kids to tear these books And books are small making them easy to carry You can just pop a book in your pocket while taking your kid out 😀 This product was a value for money  with good apt learing information for a baby Good quality and each page has one figures which makes is easy for a baby to point out or remember Love these books they are so easy to carry few to keep a toddler engaged during travel etc They like to arrange and pull out the books from the box It is toooooo small Not as given above The dimensions are not as mentioned in the product description Have attached pictures of the same with dimensions Giving 3 stars for the quality of the product Please change the picture It is misleading Returns are also not allowed I would have bought a bigger one In this price you will get a set of 10 basic books which are super good for your kids who are growing up I gave it to my nephew who is only  14 year old He loves it He keeps Playing with it for an hour and he started recognising animals and fruits So worth buying it It is a perfect gift for my 18year old babyLiked a lot and play with it and start finding the content in it I saw some users reviewing here about size of the bookfor them i must say these library books are for 13year old kids not for the adults to use Go for this without any second thoughts Book Its on exact size it needs to be Very easy to carry with infants around Sturdy Hard covers Pictures are real and in white background without any deviation My baby enjoys seeing it Good though of having all the basic topics n a single nutshellThe only con I would say is we see few repetitive objects across all the books I e Brocolli n vegetables and in Green colour as well This might be corrected to include as many new words pictures as possible Otherwise great buy No regrets Palm sized board books for babies  easy to hold and no worry of torn pages The categories and pictures will interest my kid to go through them It’s bright and colourful Bought this for my 15 year old boy He loves these books We read these everyday and he doesnt get bored looking through the same books over and over again especially the transport book Hes already learning and recognizing so many new things This is such a healthy distraction from cartoonsmobileTVPros board books so will not tear bend easily rounded edges will not hurt the child colourful clear images on every page 10 topics so lots to learn pocket size so easy to carry aroundLovely set of books to keep your child engaged Ive ordered the second set as well 1 Nice Packaging  Timely delivery2 The content  presentation is good kids would love going through the books It will surely aid in their learning process3 The books are robust it will withstand the rough handling by the lil champs4 Just the size of the books may disapppint you But overall it is value for money I bought this book a few days agowhen I received it I was amazed to see the qualitythe round edgesglossy finishnaturalizationcolorsizecombination well though out book for children definitely a buy if you children at homeany children loving parents would love itit is the best alternative of mobile phoneschildren love itlearn from reading booksSeller partThe image is a bit misleading it looks like A4but actually it is smaller than post card size I think seller should change the images shown on Amazon websiteAmazon is always the best in delivering the item in well packed and on timeThank youFor making your customers smiling like your company log The book has very foolish content for small kids of 2 3 4 yrs young kids They are showing blue color parrot they show animals guiana pig which is rarely found they show i for igloo q for quilt  etc etc so many most difficult animals and birds names which are rarelynused in day to day life and very difficult to learn for 3 yrs old kids They should have given some daily used content so that kids can easily remember and can use in their day to day life A simple book series with a picture and word per page except for the abc books last few crowded pages A child can learn and improve hisher vocabulary with this series The pages are completely worn out due to heavy usage almost everyday A warning for the parents Be prepared to read this book again and agian with your baby since they may ask for you to read them every single day for more than five to six times For a complete look of the set visit my YouTube channel  gforgratitude i have fliped through the pages from the whole setA small thing that i found is that there are two styles of this book series with same content but in a different font and picture layout style So you may get a random set we bough first set of the same series  we figured that they released second set as well So we bought this one without any second thoughtWe bought it for 350 inr thanks to amazon Books are just perfect for your small kid They will play with them as small objects initially  then eventually they will start learning to turn on pages  see different images which are of good color quality When they grow up the same set of book will serve as good vocabulary source for learning The media could not be loaded\\n                \\n            \\n                \\n            \\n        \\n    \\n    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    \\n  \\xa0I really like these board books Firstly my 20 months kid cant tear these books He can touch and feel in his own waySecondly these books are designed perfectly for the new learners All pictures have white background which helps our kid to learn fast This set of 10 books is what my threeyearold always asks for everytime I open my cupboard This package includes a set of 10 pocket sized cardboard books one each for fruits vegetables modes of transport wildlife domestic animalsbirds shapes colors numbers and A to Z The pics are crystal clear bright and attractive Overall quality of the book is worth spending your bucksThe only two negative things I found is that the book consists of all things American I doubt if parents in India will be able to relate to many fruits veggies animals shown in this book which are not found in India Cant blame the publisher as the book set is imported from USSecondly I thought the book is of full size of around the size of an A4 page but the package arrived too small It is infact pocket sized books for kids Otherwise truly a delight for the little ones to learn while they play Thumbs Up These are RS 40 each in loose and a pack of 100 would have costed me only RS 400 but still as I had to gift it I thought of buying as this set comes with hard bound case for easy storage and displayTo my disappointment the case is torn on sides and now I will have to repair it before gifting BOOK ARE REALLY GOOD BUT AGAIN U CAN EASILY FJND THEM IN ANY OF YOUR NEARBY TOY STORE I have well researched many books  concluded to this one  I got it for 399 from amazon Colors are just perfect You might get feeling that books are small in size But if you carefully research  all board books are of this sizeBooks are very well designed Corners are kept rounded to avoid accidental hurting to your baby Content is well researched as well What more My Grandson very interested these books In twenty months of age he reveals all the titles of the pictures Paper quality and pictures quality are good No question of torn the books anyway Delivery was on time packaging was excellent the Board books are of superb quality came in a card bird box there are 10 books each of which is very nice in terms of quality and colour go for it your baby’s will love it It’s a cute collection but I wasn’t expexting the size of the book to be this small  But still the books are awesome  Have 12 leaflets in all the book Books are way to small for a child to learn Because a 1 or 2 year old child needs to see bigger pictures in order to understand everything One should buy individual books rather than this library A big no thisHope you all find this helpful The media could not be loaded\\n                \\n            \\n                \\n            \\n        \\n

bends here and there which are not uncommon My son has chewed poured water stood on them Tried to press against the Binding and what not They still are running strong The books seem water resistant if not water proof Coming to the content they are clear and vibrant My son has learnt a lot in the last six months One tip is to read the books to your kids atleast 15 to 20 min every day They will develop the back of glancing or reading these board books Cant be more happy One of the best purchases If you are reading this space then I would highly recommend you to buy this set It is so engaging for little babies With its small size babies can hold it perfectly and can flip through the pages and can be engrossed in so many varieties of topics Best quality books with 10 sets of knowledge your infantchild can get from animals vegetables fruits etc Really nice book go for it Pages wont tear so easily so very durable Definitely worth buying My baby has learnt so many words from this book Especially ABC farm animals and wild animals bookFew of the animals we cant see in India so its difficult to explain it to them Like ferret  and Ginnie 🐖 Really informative books I bought them for my 15 months old toddler and he is just love with them He keeps on browsing them and want to do more and more They have also helped me in making him learn a lot of things Great quality of books it covers all topics  alphabets numbers shapes animals etc which we need a 2 year kid to see and know My niece loves to play with it Did I really expect her to read the books at this naah   Great educational product at a very affordable price The book quality is just awesome The design is made in such a way that it will seek your kids attention Very compact and can be carried easily  Very good set of books for the initial learners with very good pictures n bold letters My grand daughter of 2 Yrs of age liked all the books very much Highly recommended for kids who are started learning their first lessons Book size very small But hard board quality pictures printing and book finishing is really good Slightly expensive but serves the purpose Collection is good Good pictures perfect size for the Little onesit would be best if they have included all the BASIC animals vegetables n fruitseach book have 25pictures but some of content I found is unnecessary Bought them for my 1 year old Books are very good Quality is also great and so is the content Keeps him engaged Worth buying for little ones Go for it in case you are looking to buy some for your little one I highly recommend these boards books for children above 1 year My kid is so happy flipping the pages and identifying animals fruits etc It is very convenient for my kid to hold it as it is of small size and he thoroughly enjoys it I was so impressed by these books that I gifted these books to my nephew as well I am glad that i bought this set My baby have learned a lot from this The size is perfect for babies though it may look small at first glance Trust me i have tried a bigger book and it was too big so got torn within a week My baby will read this book as soon as she got up and before going to bed everyday Totally worth it This is my 3rd purchase and slowly has been my default gift for kids First birthday along with some toys They love them and the colours are bright and the book is hard cardboard material so kids can’t tear it for the little active kids too Thats the picture of book colors Now how do you expect me to teach color by this It should have had only plain color blue Butterfly sapphire was not required Same goes with numbers Book is 10cm in length Its board book Its not books This are pocket booksWrong way to sell item by naming BOOKS but actually items are SMALL POCKET BOOKSBasically fraud selling of small pocket books on description of Colour printed learning books actual prices are Rs100150 A great product to familiarise your toddler with some common names He can see things and relate My son enjoys it the most Dont go by long names Even if he learns one name from each book  identifies it its enough He carries atleast one book everywhere he goes My son will turn 2 in may Nice product for small babies You should buy this when your baby is just 1 yr old and he will start liking it and can enjoy it upto 3 yrs or more also It has animals fruits numbers transportation etc books Your kid will get familiar with all these things And most important  develop a love of reading touching and enjoying books The product is small curved corners so that your baby will play and dont get harmed A must buy😍😍 Awesome product My daughter luved a lot but I feel size of the book is bit small and the thickness should be more coz our books easily got Torn And im unhappy that one of my book condition was not good so bad but I didnt return Very tiny books Not satisfied with the size of the book Given limite page Easy to carry Less weight My baby didt get attract much on this book while comparing to other picture books Need better pictures Feels like repeated pictures Books are smaller in size than I thought Buy my kid loves the transport and animal books The alphabet book has some weird choices like B for Bear instead of Ball and a few others so it doesnt work well with most rhymes videos online Kids are visual learners and ever since I bough this for my 25 year old daughter she always keeps bringing these books and eagerly enquires about the contentsShe learned the names of animals and colours fast thanks to this library All you need to do is have patience as kids tend to repeatedly ask the same question multiple times about same item D I bought this for my 13 month old son who has just recently shown tendencies to read his books and not chew on them or tear them apartWhen I unwrapped the set of books I felt disappointed as they were smaller in size than I had assumed But within minutes I realised that the size was perfect for my son We spent 40 minutes right away browsing through all the books Getting that kind of attention span from my son very active son isnt easy usuallyQuality and colours are really good Easy to carry This book set is a must buy The book box is really good Initially my daughter kept playing with it to remove the book and put it backThe books classification is well thought to give a kid a flavor of different things to visualize There are minor pictures which could have been done better  such as having pictures of things which we Indians can visualize and for Nest word the picture is of a nest with big eggs and everyones eyes will go on eggs rather than a nest Anyway this is quite a minor issue which we will observe in any best books The book size is small which is just to know before buying but handly for a kid Overall the quality of information book and book box quality make it work buying for a 23 years kid 499 is far too much for 10 tiny books  The books are not very strong also a baby can easily tear them apart Bought this set of board books for my daughterVery handy for her learning basic stuffsEven though my area is lockdown  free neighbouring areas are sealed Amazon delivered the product on time as promisedLooked the product very muchThough my daughter is yet to learn all the stuffs she seems too happy to get thisOne Star is reserved for a month long usage  durability test Its very good as a first book for your baby They are colourful hard and durable This is good choice for small babies because they first chew  taste everything  These books are sturdy even if your baby chews bites it is not affected Remain in the original form My 2 yrs old son absolutely love these books He started saying A B C faster than expected We have now started Numbers and ColorsQuality of this book is good not easy to tear off Thats most important because children handle books roughly Size wise book fits inside palm So easy to carry in bag in case you want to keep children occupied Choose this one since this book has actual picturevrather than a cartooncomic version or a hand drawn version of the same which kids might have difficulty to relate while looking at real life objects Anither thing is this set is prepared keeping in mind US audience The picture for train isnt relevant avocado is not an Indian thing many animals in the books are not found in India It keeps tour baby engaged because of the vibrant content Nice buy The quality of these board books is just great The pictures are aptly represented and the content is great too I bought it when she was 13 months old and she still loves opening the books every now and then and goes through them Shes picked up quite a lot of stuff from these Please add them to your collection One of the best buy Its of great quality Nicely designed The corners are rounded wisely so not to hurt the little ones Pages are thick enough so little ones cant tear them off easily Small in sizerefer to the images posted by customers before buying but does it purposeMy 3y old just loves it It comes with a small box to store all the books after use Thats also nicely designed Usually I do not write reviews but just loved this one so thought of writing one my baby 15 year old loves it material is very good as wellWhile buying I read in reviews that the outer cover is not good quality and tears apart easy but it seems they have improved on it My baby takes out books from it 100 times a day but its still as is Using daily since 1 month I bought it after seeing its good reviews but really disappointed after getting it Size is too small to handle the thing even on a single page some pages having two items to display to save pages Rightly called as the Library with so many books in it The pages are hard enough to not be torn by your kid Colours are bright and attractive I only wish few examples related to Indian context and culture were a part of such books Very good collection of book  As it is made of thick material it will not get torn easily It is colourful The size of the books are small so it is easy for my 15 yrs old toddler to hold it and flip pages Good quality board books My 2 year old was really excited seeing it and she loves it The packing and print quality is also very good Only thing they could have included nursery rhymes as one book instead of farm animals or wild animals or transport That is why it is rated 4 stars Oh my baby loves his library It’s perfect for my baby He is just 9month old but still enjoy seeing colourful pictures and playing with these small books that is so handy for him Good quality with  very clean and clear pictures  Books are very small in sizeit will be better if the books were little bigger in sizeby the way pages are of very good quality pictures are very attractive and colourfuloverall i like itbut size matters alot It has real photos of things in various categories such as transport fruits and the like This enhances the learning process as the child can see the real thing not the animated version THis is a nice set of 10 books worth for it in fact a nice gift also for first birthday I assume Quality is good we can wipe the pages if required I wish the pages have bit more thickness Images and their colors are very natural paper quality is good and book are handy to be carried easily by kids But a few vegetable varieties and their names some English words  are not common to India For example instead of aeroplanes they have give airplane and colors teaching book is not attracting my kid interest My girl really loved these books She started observing speaking more difficult words she loves farm animals more😄 Very good gift for a kid more than chocolate or biscuits 👍 Wonderful set My toddler is 18 months and she loves learning from this Extremely child friendly and durable Only issue is the book discussing alphabets has the characters in small and unnecessary images So my daughter ended up learning those images instead of alphabets This set of books is very cute Handy and is of good quality My son loved flipping through the pages and stopping at a certain page and I told the name of the fruitobjectanimal on that page Its a fun way to teach our kids Theyll be attracted to the colourful pictures Awesome set of books  small size Handy for kidsClear pictures avoids confusion No sharp corners  Great design Useful variety of books Animals wild pet  fruits veggies vehicles etc  Great source or knowledge Nice productMaterial is so nice also the cards are thick so that child cant tear it also it is oil coated so it is safe for first learnersMy  kid is enjoying with this pretty good set of books for early learning would had preferred more of indian centric veg fruits as some listed are imports not originally avaliable in india The books comes in small size almost the size of an adults palm But the images and letters are big enough for the little ones to learn it all The material these books are made off is also pretty good Overall a very good set of books for 24 years old ideally Quality of the BOOKLET is fabulous  Bought it after reviewing the uploaded images of the people little disappointed with the size but print and quality of the paper is top notch  Keep up Nice product with pictures that keep the little ones engrossed The pages are solid cardboard and the books could have some more pictures maybeHowever no complaintsOnly that the cover was damaged when received However the books were safe thankfully Size is a bit small  should be at least 1 inch more in length The pictures are exactly the colours that should be  Very nice   for my Grandsons first library Thanks Good quality books Serves its purpose I had assumed that the box may not be of any use but it is surprisingly good It does give us the feel of a little library every time baby tries to pull out a book Good quality Clear pictures and captions Very userful to start book habit for babies and start teaching them bacis of fruits vegetables pet and wild animals vehicles etc Excellent product I had earlier purchased books from same publication but single units at a time I was hoping for similar quality when I ordered in this collection But it turned out to be a total disappointment the binding is extremely poor and doesnt look like its going to last long The thickness of the pages are also not upto the mark The finish overall is poor Size of book is small so my 17 month lo can handle it easilypictures are realisticcorner of book are round so no worry of hurtingbox was little damaged but books were in excellent conditionworth the moneyloved it Excellent set of books my son likes a lot We are actually happy with the quality of the print paper etc One improvement could be the selection of articles  may be little more indianized for a reallife experience with their learnings That does not stops me giving 5 star👍👍👍 Hi Dear Much Needed for Starting of 3 years old  child Quality is too good Attractive colors with Pictures My openion its too small need to increase  size of books Well collections with 10 books Totally Nice Oh God my baby loves to see the images and she can even identify some images and make sound that she knows it before I cant Express those in words Excellent quality and beautiful illustrations My 2 year old daughter loves it so does my wife The only drawback I can say is some of the fruits vegetables and animals shown in the books are not very common in our country Overall it is very good gifting option if you have a young child The quality of pictures in the book is very poor Also the cover is of very poor quality My 10 months  son just put the book in his mouth once and the cardboard particles started coming out of cover Didnt expect quality to be so bad Even the cardboard box in which this book was delivered was of better quality than book The product is of average quality After a few days of use the edges of the book are getting easy damaged Purchased similar product with better quality with same price Product is good but instead of 10 board books i received  only 8 and the cover was damagedDifferent set received which  is not mentioned  in the list These books are so helpful in the early learning days At first I’ve got misprinted book What an amazing customer service and prompt return and replacement Satisfied and happy customer great size n weight for a 1 year old to hold in their own hands Photo quality is good but some choices could have been better Will definitely order 2nd set soon too Got it for 449 hard strong can be brought for 1 kidsit has suffered a lot under my kid but u can stick pageshas a lot of content and clear images of things just perfect for 1 kid Its very small in size Thats is the only thing I felt badBut its is useful to kids to start learning and helps them to make  familiar of basics ohh its too good for kids specially for younger kids as young as 2 years Due to covid situation I am not able to send them to pre school but these book are very helpful and worthy The best part is quality of each book are good and children will love and learn Book cover and each pages are laminated and nice lookI highly recommend this little library We ordered it as a gift to child on her birthday The product is packaged wellwhich makes it a nice guft and the quality of the paper snd cardboard used is also very gooddurable for rough handling All the books are very attractive Images give real feel of animals etc My 10 months old baby enjoys a lot He spends a lot of time on these books Good learning for babies Though the books are easy to use corners are soft etc by small babies but still they can torn if used regularly Then there are chances they might put or swallow small paper parts of book in their mouth So keep an eye Otherwise books are very good Not value for moneyBabies get board very soon with one thingSo basically its for elder babies certainly they dont need this they are elderSo overall its very costly loved it my daughter likes to play with itshes just 9months but she likes to turn the pages and look at pictures  we are reading with the wild animals book and her animals simultaneously and she loves it

quality is good1 book is torn a bit at bottomphoto attached hard enough but to be careful not to be contact with water or salivakids Liked the quality and reality of the picture Did not like the wrong depiction of leaves in some fruits Would be better if the same pictures are not repeated in different books It is experienced many time that item seen in the picture over AMAZON portal does not match with actual product  This time this library book set is like a pocket diary I have purchased it for a 2 year kid but could not happy after purchase Very nice and attractive Kids will love it So compact and easy to hold No sharp corner edges of the book so its easy for the kids to play and it wont hurt them Just go for it Advisable for all the the tiny tots of age 15 Let me clear Please check the 346 product image before guessing its size In 1 image its looks like big but its notAlso in number book number are small and objects are bigSame in colour book black looks like brown and orange looks like yellowProQuality of Book is too good I just ordered this My first library box set for my daughters first birthday Its cute little thing and good one to start with to keep your kids engaged and to make them to get familiarise with alphabets animals etc The big and bright pictures attracts the kids Over all a good product My babys first reaction to see this WowIt is very useful for kids n very worth in this price its hard cover can keep it long but if you have more naughtiest kid then it can use for 3 months too as attached the pictures are after 8 months but good thing is that now my 23 months old baby knows various animals n learnt all colour shapes a to z 1 to 10 and he knows the difference between farm n wild animals and amazing thing is that he doesnt habbit of mobile tab or any other gadgets a Book size is not more than playing card Really disappointed with the size of the book See attached pictureb Quality is really goodc No of page is 10 in the bookd In the Number book Numbers given 1 to 20 only Limited content availablee My 4 years baby all ready knows more than given in these books So more suitable for more younger kids I purchased this for my 2 years old baby This product is great for starting Quality of pages are awesome and pages are kind of made of thick cardboard type paper and also safe for small kids to use I would recommend this personally 1 At first impression the books were really small in size2 Pictures are clear These books contain pictures that are relatable and are easy to speak and learn Eg C for cat  not crab3 As parentI am not stressed that these books can be torn by the childthis is a big plus for me You will be surprised that these books are for our dog It has stopped him from tearing up the girls homework And sometimes I do find him looking at the pictures Those books are very useful for kids upto 5 years Every book contains only 10 pages of 10 big colourful real images with names The only drawback is that some pictures or images are repeated in the pages of different books This is very good product My little one learned a lot from this item She herself brings a book and asks me to teach which is really a good sign So I would recommend this product to any mom This is an excellent program for kid Quality is good Only thing I would like that it should have Indian touch in it rather than US For example it should have Indian fruits  Indian vegetables Indian vehicles Indian pets etc in it Also ‘Bhindi’ should be ‘Lady Finger’  not Okra Its a great product for kids who have just started to learn The quality of the books was good The size was a bit small though My 15 years old baby live the books Quality of pages picture print attractive colors used in books inside nd outside for kids because of small in size it is easy to hold it in my baby’s hand nd turn over the pages He can roughly use it without a worry of damage Awesome product Even my child learn 45 new things only in one day They are very good Toddlers will easily recognise and learn things with playing It’s good to introduce first to toddlers Quality wise very goodIf you think to buy it thn definitely go for it Ideal for 12 year olds Though some items on book are difficult to pronounce for a 2 year but eventually he would learn it as the pictures are vivid I bought it for my toddler for my 10 months old infant Loved it from day one Asks me to read all the 10 books like flash cards in one sitting for twice a day After few months when he started speaking he himself identifiedread it without any help He it pulled it to pieces due to over usage So planning to rebuy the same set again Some words is highly difficult to pronounce to elders thn how abt kidsI think this cud hve been better if it is as simple as Now feeling it is waste My sister visited us with a toddler niece I gifted this book set to her and she loved it These are first set of books for my niece and she got hooked to turn and play with it immediatelyRecommend it if you are looking to introduce books to toddlers Its very nice product Got delivered in 24 hrs It was valentine gift for my toddler Books r really good for toddlers color quality all good n at reasonable rate My little one loved it Pictures were very detailed and covered all major categories She flips the pages on her own drawn to it by the attractive pics The only drawback is that toddlers less than 2 years who tend to put everything in mouth easily make it wet and it gets torn at the corners Wonderful Board books for kids which engages them most of the time I got it for my 1 yr old kid  he enjoys seeing pictures Quality is too good Wont tear that much easily Awesome colours and prints  Highly recommended Love this hard cover book for my 1 year old she loves to pretend read and it’s good for my 4 year old also he can read and spell all the names Good quality durable product Our daughter lives the stack of books Page quality is very good No fear of cut and bruise from the books Color is also good Bought it for Rs379 as a promotional offer You may check the current price  afford it My son really happy when he saw the booklet Printed in thick sheets Really awesome And images printed somewhere twice Overall its a good educational book to refer kids below 3 yrs My kid loves this set Only thing that can be improved is the sizeAnd please dont teach P for Pizza to kids from this age not advisable These books are very cute and usefulgood quality and contentmy 16 months girl is very engaged with these books Size of one books is w35 h4 inches The only drawback is the box witdh is a little less that the books fits very tightly inside and my baby couldnt pull out the book by herself untill I help her So my suggestion is to wonder house books please increase box witdh a little so the toddlers can put and take out the books easily from the box Books are too small than expectationsfelt very odd to make our child understand from such a small content Its a common sense that Babies generally love to have much bigger size which attracts them easily color is good otherwise Overall disappointed Its a good set of 10 booksPro Every thing except oneCons Images in the book should be picked from life around baby Example B stands for Bear which is rare for a baby to relate It could be Book or any othe item which is relatable for a baby Quality of books are nicecard is not too strongI got 10 books for 499that is 50 rs per booknot worth of 50 rs per bookanyway my 3yr old kid loves those books soo much which makes me satisfied Its great for 2 kids my son enjoys holding them coz its very small in size and can be easily fit in his hand but only problem is he didnt like alphabet book as it have one alphabet on each page but on last two pages 8 alphabet are written due to which he loose interest in them Our 15months baby was able to tear off the pages in couple of days The quality is below average and glue sticking the pages needs to be of higher quality Kindly improve the product than fooling customers Nice collection of introductory board books for toddlers My 3 month old loves gazing at the pictures Value for money Are these books for ants I thought these would be normal sized books Theyre absolutely too tiny for a child to comfortably hold and lack enough content lot more to learn for babies my nine months puts it inher mouth which is not safe so giving it to her only after she turns a yearoverall good  its very useful for toddler Its one of the best books basically what I noticed is its been published for selling in USA and same is being sold in India may be due to Covid anyways The books are of hard cover My baby cannot fold or tear pages and its very small and compact It has glossy plastic coating making the books sort or water resistant  Its a buy recommended from my side Thanks My daughter loves these books She get excited whenever i show her these booksThe pages are thick  so kids cant easily tear Must try The images are pretty clear too This is one of the best things Ive bought for my kid Weve been using it for almost 2 years and condition is prettty good My son isnt 3 yet but now knows names of shapes colors etc I am glad that i purchased this book Perfect size  perfect quality  perfect content Good books attractive pictures and colours Box was bit torn from corners Quality of books is good Size is

price Just go for it My baby is 18yrs old and she is just enjoying it and playing with it edges are fine books are small but enough for little one Overall a very good library to begin the world of

Twice😃 I give it a 5 star because it is the best thing u can gift to ur 2 year old child Books are small handy for child Quality of books are very nice Child can not easily tear them And of course the cover that u get with this set of book is the cutest It keep the books assembled and easy to access Product quality is goodImage displayed in the website looks too big however you have mentioned

of print paper and colors  Content printed could be betterI mean easy to spell and more familiar things from around us for a beginner  as it is for a kid who didnt start school yet Loved the books my 3 year old is in live with themThe size is small so they fit perfectly in his little handsAnd the pages are sturdy and easy to turn Product quality is good but some books might not required as first library like wild animals instead of that it should be human body parts Its a good collection of booksI got this for my baby when he was 4 monthsBut the pictures are not so bright so it will be good only for babies above 7 8 months i guessIts a normal book  not touch and feel once My kid is loving it like a candybeautiful colourshard bound and tiny size makes it a perfect book with amazing pictures for a lil kid  absolutely worth it prize Build quality is very good and all the books are well designed for learning of small children American English is used to define many animals so some names are never heard of Got it on deal Books part of the full set are duller in colour have different font and are less attractive to baby when compared to individually bought books everything about these books are very good except the size they are very small like three inches max Overall satisfied with the product but the only minus point is the size of it Would have been better if the size would have slightly bigger My little one loves it The pictures are very clear and books are just of right size for my baby to hold and explore Amazing product with plenty of education in one box  My kids loved it and learns most of the things from it It’s a good box set of board books Slightly smaller than I expected but good quality of the box and the books The pictures are nice and clear Bought it in the sale for 399 which was good The full price might be a little more for this set Its really good product for kids The quality is really niceAlthough my kid doesnt study yet he loves to play with itMust buy at this price Its a good start for child of age 15 and above manufactured to withstand heavy drop by kids and has good list of items to teach kids4 stars because I need my child to learn what is there in my country and things that we can show them in real in near future but some of thee items are of European and American It is a matter of fact that younger children have habits to tear things apart But the material that these book are made up of is great specially kept in consideration I brought so mamy book but noone last more than 2 3 dayzi found pages all over the roombut these are amazingly goodmust buy Exactly the right size for tiny hands Very few mistakes are there My child enjoyed it so much that I now gift it to other friends as well Its very small in size Size

two years daughter likes it too much I ordered this set for my 2 year old daughterand she loved itthe images shown in the book are very attractive and appealing to be learnt by a kidsince the pages

Awesome collection By 23 year old baby is totally in love with the collection Being bright colored  carrying single picture in each page and big font size it attracts my toddler a lot and she carries the collection where ever  she goes five star After seeing the reviews I bought but I am not happy with the books Quality  is good but content is not up to the mark Alphabets  are small and images are  small I bought these for my 10month baby so that he enjoys and learn alphabet Color book doesn’t show color and alphabet book shows only images not alphabet My 2 and half year old baby loves itso

ARE BOOKS NOT THE SCREEN OF MOBILE  Good set of books Untierable At first we got defective product due to some book covers torn out Later the replaced product came intactMust have book set for the kids We really love this little library for my nephew The pages are hard which cant be torn apart easily and the texture of the paper is very smooth  edges are great I like these books very much Good

for beginners Keeps baby engaged and its great fun to identify objects around baby There should be more pages and pages might be slightly thinner Packaging was goodthough size of the books are smaller should have in  little bigger in size Children can learn things from it Learn to recognize things Still I would say it is way overpriced at Rs 499 Should have come at Rs 200250 Very good books but one
